# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

This group project uses the HAR data provided by UC Irvine. Deliverables in this repo are for COSC 522: Machine Learning.

## Objective

Use machine learning algorithms to take samples consisting of gyroscope and other sensor data and classify these readings into 1 of 6 activities:

  - Standing
  - Walking
  - Sitting
  - Laying down
  - Walking upstairs
  - Walking downstairs

## Running the Jupyter Notebook
